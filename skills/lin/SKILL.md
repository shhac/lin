# Linear automation with `lin`

`lin` is a CLI binary installed on `$PATH`. Invoke it directly (e.g. `lin issue list --team ENG`).

List/search output is JSONL by default. `get <id>...` commands default to NDJSON (one line per id — the record, or `{"@unresolved":{...}}` for a missing id); pass `--format json` to get a pretty object. Use `--format json|yaml|jsonl` to override any command. Errors go to stderr as `{ "error": "...", "fixable_by": "agent|human|retry", "hint": "..." }` with non-zero exit.

## IMPORTANT: Never access the Linear API directly

**NEVER retrieve, read, or use the Linear API key directly.** Do not `curl` the Linear API. Do not use environment variables to extract credentials. `lin` handles all authentication internally.

If a specific `lin` command doesn't exist for what you need:

1. Check `lin <command> usage` — the command may exist but not be obvious from `--help`
2. Use `lin api query '<graphql>'` as a last resort — it runs raw GraphQL through `lin`'s auth

## Quick start (auth)

Set an env var (recommended):

```bash
export LINEAR_API_KEY="lin_api_..."
```

Or store it locally (supports multiple workspaces — each Linear API key is per-org):

```bash
lin auth login <api-key> --alias myorg
lin auth status
lin auth workspace list
lin auth workspace switch <alias>
lin auth logout [--all]
lin auth workspace remove <alias>
```

Generate a personal API key at **Settings > Account > Security > Personal API Keys** in the Linear app.

**Multi-user MCP:** one `lin mcp` server can serve several people. Each named principal's calls run pinned to their own workspace (`--workspace <alias>` + fail-closed `LIN_REQUIRE_IDENTITY`). Bind a principal explicitly with `mcp pair add <name> --bind workspace=<alias>`, or leave them unbound to self-enroll — they paste their own Linear API key in the browser during OAuth approval and it is stored under their name. A slot converges on one Linear org; a key for a different org is refused.

## Looking up issues

```bash
lin issue search "auth bug"
lin issue list --team ENG --status "In Progress" --assignee "alice@example.com"
lin issue get ENG-123             # NDJSON by default; includes branchName, commentCount, attachments (PR links)
lin issue get ENG-123 ENG-456     # multi-get: one NDJSON line per id (or @unresolved for missing)
lin issue comment list ENG-123
```

## Creating and updating issues

```bash
lin issue new "Fix login redirect" --team ENG --priority high --status "Todo" --labels "Bug"
lin issue update status ENG-123 "In Progress"
lin issue update assignee ENG-123 "alice@example.com"
lin issue update priority ENG-123 urgent
lin issue update project ENG-123 "Bundles self-serve"   # move to a project (name, slug, or UUID)
lin issue update estimate ENG-123 5      # validated against team's estimate scale
lin issue update due-date ENG-123 2025-03-15
lin issue update cycle ENG-123 <cycle-uuid>
lin issue update parent ENG-123 ENG-100  # make sub-issue
lin issue comment new ENG-123 "Started investigating"
lin issue comment new ENG-123 "Replying" --parent <comment-id>   # threaded reply (1 level max)
lin issue comment new ENG-123 "See attached" --file ./screenshot.png  # upload file(s)
lin issue comment get <comment-id>           # includes parent, childCount
lin issue comment edit <comment-id> "Updated" --file ./report.pdf
lin issue comment replies <comment-id>       # list replies (paginated)
```

## Files (upload and download)

```bash
# Upload files to Linear's CDN — returns asset URLs
lin file upload ./screenshot.png ./report.pdf

# Download files from Linear's CDN
lin file download https://uploads.linear.app/<org>/<uuid>/<uuid>
lin file download <uuid>/<uuid>              # org inferred from auth
lin file download <uuid>                      # single UUID
lin file download <uuid>/<uuid> --output ./report.pdf
lin file download <uuid>/<uuid> --output-dir ./downloads
lin file download <uuid>/<uuid> --stdout | cat > file.bin
lin file download <uuid>/<uuid> --force       # overwrite existing
```

`file download` defaults to the lin cache (`~/.cache/lin/downloads`) and reports
the absolute `path`; `--output`/`--output-dir`/`--stdout` override it.

**Over MCP (`lin mcp`):** a client has no filesystem, so the reported `path`
comes back as a fetchable reference (`{"@type":"file","root":"cache","path":"downloads/…"}`)
that you read with the bridge's built-in **`fs`** tool — e.g.
`fs get cache downloads/diagram.png` returns the bytes (images as image blocks),
`fs find cache -e png` / `fs ls cache downloads` discover them. No host path needed.

> **Prefer `--file` on comments** when attaching files to issues. `lin issue comment new ENG-123 "See attached" --file ./screenshot.png` uploads and embeds the file in a single step. Use `lin file upload` only when you need a standalone asset URL (e.g., for issue descriptions or documents).

## Issue history

```bash
lin issue history ENG-123                    # activity log (status, assignee, labels, etc.)
lin issue history ENG-123 --limit 10         # last 10 changes
```

## Issue relations and lifecycle

```bash
# Relations (blocks, duplicate, related)
lin issue relation list ENG-123
lin issue relation add ENG-123 --type blocks --related ENG-124
lin issue relation remove <relation-id>

# Archive and delete
lin issue archive ENG-123
lin issue unarchive ENG-123
lin issue delete ENG-123                  # moves to trash

# Attachments (link PRs, docs, Slack messages, etc.)
lin issue attachment list ENG-123
lin issue attachment add ENG-123 "https://example.com/spec.pdf" --title "Spec doc"        # default: rich link, server detects integration
lin issue attachment add ENG-123 "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/456" --github-pr        # force GitHub PR integration
lin issue attachment add ENG-123 "https://github.com/org/repo/issues/789" --github-issue
lin issue attachment add ENG-123 "https://gitlab.com/group/project/-/merge_requests/42" --gitlab-mr
lin issue attachment add ENG-123 "https://app.slack.com/client/T0/C0/p1700000000000000" --slack --sync-thread
lin issue attachment add ENG-123 "https://discord.com/channels/<guild>/<channel>/<message>" --discord
lin issue attachment remove <attachment-id>      # works for any source type
```

## Projects

Project commands accept UUID, slug ID, or name.

```bash
lin project search "migration"
lin project list --status started                  # filters by status type OR custom status name
lin project list --lead me --status started        # "projects I lead that are In Progress"
lin project get "CRM Actions"            # accepts UUID, slug, or name — includes content (markdown body)
lin project issues <id>
lin project new "New Feature" --team ENG --status planned --lead "alice@example.com"
lin project update status <id> completed
lin project update content <id> "# Updated body content"
lin project update start-date <id> 2025-01-15
lin project update target-date <id> 2025-03-31
lin project update priority <id> high
lin project update labels <id> "Discovery, Roadmap"   # replaces project labels (project labels, not issue labels)
lin project delete <id>                  # moves to trash
lin project unarchive <id>               # restore trashed/archived project
```

**Project updates (health/status posts)** — Linear's timeline posts with a health
signal, distinct from `project update <field>` which edits a project field:

```bash
lin project post new "Bundles self-serve" "🎉 Bundles is live!" --health on-track
lin project post list "Bundles self-serve"   # newest first, paginated
lin project post get <update-id>
# --health: on-track | at-risk | off-track
```

The `--project` filter on issue commands also accepts slug or name.

## Customer requests

A customer request (Linear "customer need") links a customer to an issue or
project. A request has **no status of its own** — its state is the linked
issue's state, so "in triage" and "unassigned" are filters on the linked issue.
Importance is a flag on the request itself (`important: true` ⇒ priority 1).
Requests have no labels; categorize by the linked issue's labels or the
customer's tier/status. Customers accept UUID, slug, or name.

```bash
# Triage workflow — answer "what needs attention?"
lin customer requests                          # all requests, newest first
lin customer requests --important              # flagged important
lin customer requests --unassigned             # linked issue has no assignee
lin customer requests --triage                 # linked issue still in triage
lin customer requests --customer "Acme Corp"   # everything one customer asked for
lin customer requests --team ENG --important   # important requests routed to a team

# Customers
lin customer list --tier Enterprise --status Active
lin customer search "acme"
lin customer get acme-corp                     # UUID, slug, or name; includes approximateNeedCount
lin customer statuses                          # workspace lifecycle statuses
lin customer tiers                             # workspace tiers/segments

# From the other direction
lin issue requests ENG-123                     # requests linked to one issue
lin project requests <id>                      # requests linked to one project
lin issue get ENG-123                          # includes customerRequestCount + customerImportantCount
```

## Initiatives (replaces roadmaps)

```bash
lin initiative search "migration"
lin initiative list --status active
lin initiative get <id>                  # status, health, owner, projects
lin initiative projects <id>             # projects linked to initiative
lin initiative new "Q3 Launch" --status planned --owner "alice@example.com"
lin initiative update name <id> "New Name"
lin initiative update status <id> active
lin initiative update description <id> "Updated description"
lin initiative update owner <id> "alice@example.com"
lin initiative update content <id> "# Updated body"
lin initiative update color <id> "#FF5500"
lin initiative update icon <id> "🚀"
lin initiative update target-date <id> 2025-06-30
lin initiative archive <id>
lin initiative unarchive <id>
lin initiative delete <id>
```

Initiative statuses: `planned`, `active`, `completed`.

## Documents

Document commands accept UUID or slug ID.

```bash
lin document search "onboarding"
lin document list --project "CRM Actions" --creator "alice@example.com"
lin document get <id>                    # full markdown content
lin document new "API Design Doc" --project "CRM Actions" --content "# Overview\n..."
lin document update title <id> "New Title"
lin document update content <id> "# Updated content"
lin document update project <id> "Other Project"
lin document history <id>                # content edit history (actor IDs + timestamps)
```

## Teams, users, labels, cycles

```bash
lin team list
lin team get ENG                         # includes estimate config + valid values
lin team states ENG                      # workflow states (discover valid status values)
lin user me
lin user list --team ENG
lin label list --team ENG                # issue labels under a team (incl. workspace-wide)
lin label list --name "Bug"              # exact-name match (case-insensitive); shows team for each result
lin label search "perf"                  # substring search (case- and accent-insensitive)
lin label get "Test coverage" --team ENG # single label; --team disambiguates duplicate names
lin label get <uuid>                     # always unique
lin label list --type project            # workspace-wide project labels (no --team — projects labels aren't team-scoped)
lin label search "discovery" --type project
lin label get "Discovery" --type project
lin cycle list ENG --current
lin cycle get <id>
```

## Truncation

Long text fields (`description`, `body`, `content`) are truncated to ~200 characters by default. A companion `*Length` field (e.g. `descriptionLength`) always shows the full size.

To see full content, use `--expand` or `--full`:

```bash
lin --full issue get ENG-123                             # expand all fields
lin --expand description issue get ENG-123               # expand specific field
lin --expand description,content project get <id>        # expand multiple
```

These are global flags — place them before the command or after it.

To read an entity in a terminal (not for scripting), use `--format pretty`:

```bash
lin issue get ENG-123 --format pretty                    # human-readable card
lin --full issue get ENG-123 --format pretty             # + relations and comments
lin project get <id> --format pretty --width 100         # set card width
```

## IDs

All commands accept multiple ID formats:

- Issue keys: `ENG-123`
- UUIDs: `aaaaaaaa-1111-2222-3333-444444444444`
- URL slugs: `fix-login-redirect-abc123`
- `--team` accepts team key (`ENG`) or name (`Engineering`)

## Pagination

List/search commands default to JSONL: one item per line. If another page exists, the final line is `{"@pagination":{"has_more":true,"next_cursor":"..."}}`.

Use `--format json` for an envelope: `{ "data": [...], "pagination"?: { "has_more": true, "next_cursor": "..." } }`.

Use `--limit <n>` and `--cursor <token>` to paginate.

## Global flags and defaults

- `--format json|yaml|jsonl`: override output format for this invocation
- `--format pretty` (get commands only): human-readable terminal card for reading an entity — not for scripting. Supported on `issue`, `project`, `initiative`, `document`, and `customer` get. Color is used on a terminal and dropped when piped or `NO_COLOR` is set.
- `--width <n>`: card width for `--format pretty` (0 = auto-detect terminal)
- `--workspace <alias>`: act as a specific stored workspace for this invocation, overriding the default. Resolves strictly by alias (unknown alias errors). When `LIN_REQUIRE_IDENTITY` is set, this flag is mandatory and resolution fails closed before any fallback (default workspace / legacy key / `LINEAR_API_KEY`).
- `--timeout <ms>`: request timeout in milliseconds
- `--debug`: log redacted HTTP request records to stderr
- `--expand <field,...>` / `--full`: expand truncated long text fields. With `--format pretty`, `--full` also fetches relations and comments for `issue get`.

Persist commonly-used defaults with:

```bash
lin config set output.defaultFormat jsonl
lin config set request.timeoutMS 10000
```

## Per-command usage docs

Every top-level command has a `usage` subcommand with detailed, LLM-optimized docs:

```bash
lin issue usage          # all issue subcommands, flags, valid values
lin project usage        # project commands
lin initiative usage     # initiative commands
lin document usage       # document commands
lin team usage           # team, user, label, cycle commands
lin auth usage           # auth + workspace management
lin file usage           # file upload + download commands
lin config usage         # CLI settings keys, defaults, validation
lin usage                # top-level overview (~1000 tokens)
```

Use `lin <command> usage` when you need deep detail on a specific domain before acting.

## Raw GraphQL (escape hatch)

When no structured command covers your needs, use `lin api query` instead of accessing the API directly:

```bash
lin api query '{ viewer { id name email } }'
lin api query '{ issue(id: "ENG-123") { id title createdAt completedAt } }'
lin api query 'query($id: String!) { issue(id: $id) { id title } }' --variables '{"id":"ENG-123"}'
```

Always prefer structured commands first — they handle pagination, ID resolution, and formatting.
